# Scrimba Projects Portfolio (In Progress)

Welcome to my collection of projects from the [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com) Fullstack development path course! This repository showcases my journey learning web development through hands-on projects.

## About Me

A student from the Philippines! Taking a certificate program in Associates in Computing Technology at De La Salle Lipa.

### Why did I start Scrimba?
I was looking for resources to help me build my portfolio and interests in web development, and Scrimba has helped me reach my foundational goals in learning full-stack development.

### What did I learn so far?
- HTML, CSS & JavaScript fundamentals
- Understanding Accessibility in Websites
- Essential JS (Error Handling & Asynchronous Programming)
- Responsive Design (Mobile first design)
- Version control with Git and GitHub

### Goals and Modules I am currently working on

There are still quite a few more modules to work on in the Scrimba course, listed are:
- AI Engineering
- Node.js, Express.js, and React.js environments
- Databases
- Typescript
- UI Design

Future goals:
- Have a presentable portfolio (website)
- Work in tech companies that focus on web development (or any tech stack within my skill set)
