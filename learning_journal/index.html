                    <span class="bold">How I stay committed to learning</span>
                    <p>
                        I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours
                        and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using what I learned
                        or work new techniques into existing projects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what
                        I was learning and most things about my journey with the world.
                    </p>
                    <span class="bold">How I got started</span>
                    <p>
                        I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take
                        notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes
                        to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of what I
                        learned using my own words.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my
                        learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.
